## Evaluation
### Facebook

   - **Category:** Social 
   - **Mobile:** Equally divided between website and mobile, have same features.
   - **Story:** Allows users to share their lives and connect with people around the world
   - **Market:** Anyone that wants to connect with others can use the app. Users can form groups and pages to find others with similar interests.
   - **Habit:** Users can post throughout the day many times. Features like "Stories" encourage more candid posting as well. Extremely habit forming.
   - **Scope:** Instagram started out as a platform to connect with others and posting on your wall. It's expanded to include many features such as messaging, marketplace etc.

## App Ideas


Nadia: 
1. App to connect college students who want to store things over the summer with people living nearby with extra space in their house
2. App that blocks other apps for specific durations e.g. facebook while studying
3. App that collates important news articles so that you don't have to check each media 
4. App that summarizes articles and readings
5. Connect volunteers to volunteer opportunities 
6. Simulate behavioral and coding interviews to let users practice


Daniel: 
1. Budget App for College Students Ideally
- This app would allow college students to create a budget and would remind students how much they've spent/have left to meet budget
2.  Reddit type App 
- Allows for people to connect through people's postings; people can have conversations on a thread
3. Application for renting out apartments
- Similarly to airbnb, but would allow people to rent out their apartments for longer periods of time. Would require  a background check
4. Study group application for college/HS Students
- Would allow people on a campus to create and meet up for study groups based on majors, classes or simply to study 
5. Couponing app 
- Allows for users to share their coupon finds


Isha: 
1. High School-College Connecting app
- allows high school students (probably seniors) to connect with college students at a university they are interested in and meet up/get individualized tours
2. Textbook Exchange app
- students post about books they want to sell and others can buy from them for cheaper instead of ordering
3. Mix of Google Drive/Notepad/Calendar app
- organizer on phone where you can create folders and add in notes or plan dates or add important dates/reminders all in one place, like an agenda
4. Book/Supplies Donation app
- people can donate extra books or school supplies they have that they no longer use, which can be accessible by those in need, like students at under-resourced schools
5. Rental app
- people post that they have something they are willing to rent (ex. chairs for a program or suits or clothes for teenagers) and others can rent it and return without having to buy and keep it


Wilman: 

1. Fund collecting app for student organizations. Organizations can offer services such as tutoring sessions and one on one time with company representatives in exchange for a fixed amount.
2. App that tests you with a riddle in order to get access to your phone when you go out to party.
3. App that allows the user to design a diagram on a google maps map to show how to get to a location within an apartment complex or another tricky location.
4. App that keeps a record of how often you go through your groceries and gives you a message indicating what you need to replenish right before it runs out.
5. App that allows to launch pop up events for any number of users.

## Evaluation
### Textbook Exchange
- **Category:** Education
- **Mobile:** Primarily mobile; could have a website but most users would probably use it on their phone. Add location, camera, and messaging features.
- **Story:** Valuable to students because it helps them save money and get rid of textbooks they don't need anymore.
- **Market:** Provides huge value to any student (college and high school).
- **Habit:** Used most often a few times a semester, mainly at the beginning or end.
- **Scope:** The basic structure and functionality should be achievable, but the additional features may be more technically challenging.


### Study Group
- **Category:** Education
- **Mobile:** Allows for students to find groups easily and in real-time while they're on the go, so experience is primarily mobile. More than a glorified website because of its convenience.
- **Story:** Valuable to students who needs help or looking to connect to people in their major or class to study together.
- **Market:** Any student 
- **Habit:** Frequently during the semester, habit-forming as users use it to form and find study groups.
- **Scope:** The basic structure and functionality should be achievable, but the additional features may be more technically challenging.

### News Articles
- **Category:** News, Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Could have a website too, but mobile app will allow users to find articles on the go and in realtime.
- **Story:** Allows users to have access to important news articles without having to check each media
- **Market:** Anyone who wants to stay updated on current news but doesn't have as much time to peruse every single news platform
- **Habit:** User would use it daily if they like to read news often.
- **Scope:** Should be achievable, most challenging part would be selecting or ordering the articles according to their "importance"
